# Transfer_Entropy
Marc Brittain

[**Transfer Entropy**], [**python**]

The goal of this notebook is to introduce the transfer entropy tool that was devolped by Lizer and provide different examples of how it can be used in python. Recall that transfer entropy can tell you how much uncertainty is decreased in knowing the next state of system by know the current state of another system.
I have also developted code to allow for easier integration into new scenarios. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me [here](https://marcbrittain.github.io)
